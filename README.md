While loop Task

This is a project I completed on my Software Engineering bootcamp.

- The task was to create a program that continually asks the user to enter a number above 0

- When the user enters "-1" the program should stop asking the user to enter a number

- The program must then calculate the average of the numbers entered, excluding the "-1"

- Make use of the 'While Loop' repetition structure to implement the program
